			<h3> What no one tells you about being raped </h3>
			<p> No one tells you you’ll spend the next six months wide awake at night staring at your ceiling, reliving the moment he pushed himself inside you without your permission.
No one will tell you about the nightmares. The constant fear. How you won’t be able to walk down a street at night without constantly looking over your shoulder.
No one will tell you how long it will take you to be able to have sex again. To trust someone. To let someone in. No one will tell you how the meaning of sex will change for you after rape. How allowing someone to be inside you will take on a whole new meaning.
No one could have prepared you for the moment he wrapped his hands around your neck and started to squeeze. The moment you started praying that maybe you would pass out so that you wouldn’t have to live through what you knew was going to happen next. Wondering whether being unconscious would be better than the alternative.
No one could have prepared you for the shame you felt as you grabbed your clothes and your belongings and walked home half-naked, as bruises started to colour your body.

				<h3> To my body </h3>
				<p> I never thought that the day would come where I am able to appreciate you and thank you. But here we are. I have realized all that you do for me, and my heart is filled with gratitude. I have tortured you, and I am so, so incredibly sorry. From here on out, I will treat you with the respect you deserve. You and me are on the same team, and it’s time that I start to act like it.
I am sorry that I have starved you and deprived you of the nutrients you needed to grow and prosper. You don’t ask very much of me, and I ignored the warning signs you gave me to let me know that you were hurting. I am sorry that I neglected you of the simple things that you need to survive. I will feed you and water you and make sure you are healthy.
I am sorry that I cut and burned your pure skin. You are a temple: a temple of healing, of growth, of hope, and I violated that. I promise to rebuild you. I promise to let you heal and to protect you from wounds whenever I can.
I am sorry that I spent hours on the treadmill, breaking the joints that you so preciously built. Your muscles and bones deserve a chance to heal and regenerate, and I will allow them this. I will engage in activities that are healthy and will lead us to be stronger together.
I am sorry that I put us in unsafe situations and had you violated multiple times. You and I deserve to be respected, and I will do my best to keep us safe.

					<h3> Abuse </h3>
					<p> A word so little spoken about it. 
A word so softly spoken sex seems more glorified and yet it happens more often. 
Recently I've spoken to so many people about this each with their own stories, stories of heartbreak so wild you could see them no longer, or mental disarray thoughts were no longer legitimate but worst of all of abuse so often it seems the norm.
Nobody should suffer in any relationship a form of abuse, regards of type, formation or origins once it takes root abuse spreads like wild flowers in the cracks of foundations; taking over and consuming love.
Of more recent thought I realized unknowingly I was a pawn in a game of abuse; mentally and emotionally I was under siege in a relationship.
This siege wasn't noticeable to me, it wasn't a topic I believed was a concern for me I was young and happy in a relationship of good contentment and fullness but yet abuse isn't noticeable to those that suffer.

						<h3> Unlabeled relationship </h3>
						<p> I wonder what happened between us. I used to wake up with your “Good morning” messages talk with you all day and at night with a “Goodnight”. I seldom ask myself what happened, what goes wrong? what was the reason we end up like this? was it me? was it because fighting become our habit or maybe we just don’t deserve each other? but those are just an unanswered question.
Everything goes black and all i was thinking that time was i need you back, i need you back in my diurnal rhythm. 
I miss the “US” even though that “US” was just you by yourself and me on my own. I miss the way you call my name and the way you smile. 
I miss our midnight conversations and your songs especially when you’re asking me this remarkable question “Do you want me to sing for you?” I miss everything, i miss everything about you.
