		<body> <h1> Abuse </h1>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p> A word so little spoken about it. 
			A word so softly spoken sex seems more glorified and yet it happens more often. 
			Recently I've spoken to so many people about this each with their own stories, stories of heartbreak so wild you could see them no longer, or mental disarray thoughts were no longer legitimate but worst of all of abuse so often it seems the norm.
			Nobody should suffer in any relationship a form of abuse, regards of type, formation or origins once it takes root abuse spreads like wild flowers in the cracks of foundations; taking over and consuming love. 

		<p> Of more recent thought I realized unknowingly I was a pawn in a game of abuse; mentally and emotionally I was under siege in a relationship.
			This siege wasn't noticeable to me, it wasn't a topic I believed was a concern for me I was young and happy in a relationship of good contentment and fullness but yet abuse isn't noticeable to those that suffer. 
			I was placed in a corner of my mind that caused my mentality to suffer, development of myself was questioned, I wondered was I good enough, could I be the person they needed, was I worthy of their time and mostly why couldn't I give them enough in the world.
		<p> I believed love was self doubt, it was a formation of angry words that turned into apoloizes of I love you and crying in their arms. 
		<p> I believed love was routine, sadness in a glass of stale ale and questioning how I got to become one of those that drowns in sorrows. 
		<p> I believed love was silence and fights, hidden truths and anguish. 
		<p> I believed my unhappiness was my fault, that I caused the faults in this relationship, that my own paranoia caused by their words was what led to it all but I didn't see. 
		<p> I didn't see that, that was abuse.
		<p> The self doubt, hurt, low self esteem and lack of myself was caused by abuse. 
		<p> Abuse is hidden in words, under sheets that hold you close, wrapped around your life like a ring where your lover proclaimed property. 
			Abuse is the norm.
			Yet we say nobody should suffer of it with such force; force of affirmation.
			Yet; abuse is the norm
